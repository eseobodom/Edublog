    <h2>Concept of Hardware and Software </h2>
    <img src="IMG1.jpg" alt="Hardware Diagram"/>
    <p> Hardware and software are essential parts of a computer system. Hardware and software interact with each other. The software “tells” the hardware which tasks to perform, and hardware makes it possible to actually perform them.
Hardware components are the physical parts of a computer, like the central processing unit (CPU), mouse, storage, and more. Software components are the set of instructions that we store and run on our hardware. Together, they form a computer. The term hardware refers to mechanical device that makes up computer. Computer hardware consists of interconnected electronic devices that we can use to control computers operation, input and output. Examples of hardware are CPU, keyboard, mouse, hard disk, etc. 
Software is a set of instructions that drives computer to do stipulated tasks is called a program. Software describes a collection of programs and procedures that perform tasks on a computer. Software is an ordered sequence of instructions that change the state of a computer’s hardware. There are three general types of software: Software instructions are programmed in a computer language, translated into machine language, and executed by computer. 
</p>
    <h2>Types of Hardware Technology</h2>
    <p>Computer hardware can be categorized as being either internal or external components. Generally, internal hardware components are those necessary for the proper functioning of the computer, while external hardware components are attached to the computer to add or enhance functionality. Given below are the types of computer hardware: 
    <br>
    <br>1. RAM 
    <br> RAM (Random Access Memory) may be a form of component that’s accustomed store the data then processing that information. The processing speed of RAM is far faster than a tough disk but Ram may be a volatile device which implies when an ADPS stops working all the data stored is exhausted from RAM whereas a tough disk is non-volatile which suggests it stores the information permanently in it. The information may be easily stored in RAM and might be easily fetched from RAM. The fetch process of information is extremely fast in Ram compared to disk. There are two styles of RAM SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) and DRAM (Dynamic random access memory). The employment of SRAM is during a cache memory of the CPU and therefore the DRAM is generally employed in modern computers. 
    <br>
    <br>2. Hard-disk 
    The fixed disk is another variety of element that’s accustomed to storing the info in it. The hard disc is often preinstalled on the CPU or is used as an external device. The fixed disk is that the non-volatile component which implies the information is stored permanently within the hard disc and it doesn’t wipe out when the system is closed up. The disk contains an electromagnet surface which is employed to store huge chunks of information and may be accessed easily. The magnetic disk has the capacity to store trillions of bytes of knowledge in its storage, within the internal of the disk, it’s a set of stacked disks that have electromagnetic surfaces accustomed to storing data in it. Every magnetic disk incorporates a certain processing speed which varies from 4200-15000 rpm. The upper the rpm more is that the processing speed of a tough disk. The high processing speed is employed in supercomputers. 
    <br>
    <br>3. Monitor 
    <br> The monitor is often compared to the tv set but the difference is that the resolution and graphics displayed by the monitor are of much top quality compared to the tv set. The desktop is connected via a cable and gets fitted during a computer video card which is installed within the motherboard of the pc system. For laptops, tablets the monitor is pre-built within the system and there’s no separate hardware installed in these devices. There are two varieties of computer monitors which are CRT and LCD. The LCD is employed during a modern computer as they’re thinner and lighter and straightforward to use compared to CRT monitors. 
    <br>
    <br>4. CPU 
   <br> The CPU could be a core part of any PC, laptop, tablet, and notebook. The CPU is additionally called the brain of the pc as every operation is executed within the CPU only. The CPU is created of a computer chip that contains billions of small transistors installed thereon. All the calculations are performed inside these transistors. the opposite hardware components which are monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, electronic equipment are connected o the CPU.
